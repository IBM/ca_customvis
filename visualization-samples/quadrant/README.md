# Quadrant

## Description
The 'quadrant' sample is a variation of the scatter sample. It shows a scatter visualization with four quadrants and renders the quadrant in different colors. In addition, text labels are placed on the axes and inside the quadrants. Points and labels in the visualization use an animation when they are positioned and sized.

## Objective
- Use animation in visualizations.
- Render axis titles.
- Implement selection and highlighting (raise elements).
- Use custom data domains.
