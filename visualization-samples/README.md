# customvis-samples

## Summary
This repo holds code samples for developers of custom visualizations. The code samples found here have the purpose of illustrating certain aspects of the customvis library and tools.

This means that the main focus of each sample is not completeness of the visualization, showing how certain things work. Each sample is fully documented and tested and can be made publicly available.

## Running a sample
You can run any sample locally by running `customvis start` inside the folder that contains the sample. After that, you can use the 'Preview Vis' in IBM Cognos Analytics Dashboard or Reporting to insert the custom visualization in your dashboard or report.

Alternatively, you can package a sample with `customvis pack` and upload it to Cognos Analytics.
