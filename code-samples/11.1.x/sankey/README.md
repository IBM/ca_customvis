# Sankey

## Description
The 'sankey' sample shows a Sankey chart that visualizes a directed flow from one set of elements to another. The elements are specified in a 'from' and 'to' slot. Elements are connected with 'links', and each link can have a weight value. Each element is rendered as a small rectangle (a 'node') that is colored uniquely for that element.

The Sankey custom visualization is not supported in Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.

## Objectives
- Use a third party library in a visualization.
- Implement custom hit testing.
- Implement selection and highlighting using color and font.
